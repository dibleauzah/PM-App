# PM-App
**Gabe-Seif Project-Management Open-Source Site/App**

***Introduction/Description***

> A full-stack site/app (meaning, it has backend capabilities, e.g. user logins, databases, etc.), built using React--i.e., the MERN* stack. The project has two main overarching goals: 
> 1)--To help myself--and anyone else that is interested--with learning about said (MERN) stack, and most importantly, software development in general. 
> 2)--To help anyone, as well as project-managers in particular, with planning and executing their personal or work simple tasks (or task-sets), and projects.

> But it should also be able to be easily customized as an iOS & Android app
>> *Thus, we will also use Material UI

> Main purpose of the site/app: an open-source site/app to help project-managers and other individuals easily organize their general affairs and/or--especially--work-tasks and errands.

> Basically, a more sophisticated full-stack version of the common to-do list code-learning project

> Main and sub-categories, and work-features; i.e., these are going to be the main categories and work-features under which users can group the elements of their main projects:

Organizer 1: for simple(r) tasks:

> Simple task list format

Organizer 2: for complicated errands and/or work-tasks:
