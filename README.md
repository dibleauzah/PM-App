# PM-App
**Gabe-Seif Project-Management Open-Source Site/App**

***Introduction/Description***

> A full-stack site/app (meaning, it has backend capabilities, e.g. user logins, databases, etc.), built using React--i.e., the MERN* stack. But it should also be able to be easily customized as an iOS & Android app. *Thus, we will also use Material UI. The project has two main overarching goals: 

>> 1)--To help myself--and anyone else that is interested--with learning about said (MERN) stack, and most importantly, software development/engineering in general; 

>> 2)--To help anyone, as well as project-managers in particular, with planning and executing their personal or professional simple tasks (or task-sets), and complex projects.

> Basically, this software-development project is envisioned as a more sophisticated full-stack version of the common "to-do" list code-learning project.

> Basic knowledge sources, set 2:

General publicly-available information about project-management, "donated"/contributed by anyone with formal and informal--but evidence-based, theoretical or/and practical project-management expertise. I for one (Seif Sekalala, Ph.D., CAPM [https://profseifsekalala.wordpress.com/]) have a significant and ever-growing amount of knowledge and experience in this context.

Thank everyone, for your support! 🙂🙏
